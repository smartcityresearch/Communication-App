ðŸ§  Internship Experience â€“ Smart City Living Lab (SCRC), IIIT Hyderabad
I worked as a Software Research Intern at the Smart City Research Center (SCRC), IIIT Hyderabad, where I contributed to impactful projects at the intersection of software systems and real-world automation.

ðŸ”¬ Key Contributions:
Lab Automation Using Live Camera Feeds (with Hemanth, another intern)

Researched and tested real-time object detection models (YOLOv11, MobileNetV3) on Raspberry Pi for automating lab activity detection.

Benchmarked models for performance under constrained hardware environments, enabling edge-based intelligence for smart labs.

Solo Full-Stack Project: Communication & Notification System

Designed and developed an end-to-end scalable communication app using React Native (Expo) for the frontend and a Dockerized Express.js backend.\n - Integrated Supabase, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and ESP32 hardware to send real-time notifications, drive buzzer/display boards, and manage access control.\n - Implemented features like onboarding authentication, real-time updates, push notifications with read receipts, and domain-based group alerts.

ðŸ“š Learnings & Takeaways:
Gained hands-on experience with React Native, Docker, and backend infrastructure.

Learned how to collaborate in a structured, research-driven environment using tools like OpenProject for ticket tracking and GitHub for version control and documentation.

Developed a deeper appreciation for the Smart City ecosystem through regular team meetings, mentorship, and interaction with ongoing research efforts.

Worked closely with hardware interfaces, particularly the ESP32, integrating them seamlessly with modern cloud-based software stacks.

Beyond the technical growth, the internship provided a glimpse into corporate culture, teamwork, and the discipline required for scalable, production-grade research prototyping.
